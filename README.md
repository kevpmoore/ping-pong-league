### User stories


### Implementation



## Technologies/resources used
* Node.js
* Express.js
* AngularJS
* HTML
* Sass
* Bourbon Neat


## Further improvements

* E2E testing to check order by functionality in the player leaderboard
* remove global controller and separate components into modular structure according to function, define both a Player and a Game module - better separation of responsibilities. This will be useful as the app gets more complicated with the addition of more features
* Improve unit test coverage
* Add controls on form to ensure users cannot add games when the form fields have not been completed correctly - ie if same name is used, or if the same scores have been inputted
